             a place to post your favorite recipes so that others can prepare and enjoy them as well. Whisky Network also provides a way for everyone to easily adapt
             a recipe to the size that best suits their needs.

            We are working on a project for our Web Based Design final website. We chose to do a recipe based website because we both love cooking/baking recipes.
